<h1 align="center">What is a Limit?</h1>


To be frankly honest, after graduating High School, i'd completely forgotten most of Math because of work (and also bad memory lol).

Okay, basically a **limit** is a fundamental concept in Calculus that describes the behavior of a function as the input approaches a certain value. Limits are used to define **continuity, derivatives, and integrals,** which are core ideas of Calculus.

Let's say, you're going somewhere and then you face the wall. As you get closer it **never** gets closer. Your limit distance to that wall is **zero**, it will never reach to you exactly.

Theoretically, it's written like this:

$$
\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L
$$

In this case, as ***x*** gets closer to ***a***, the function ***f(x)*** gets closer and closer to ***L***.

For example:
$$
\lim 
$$
