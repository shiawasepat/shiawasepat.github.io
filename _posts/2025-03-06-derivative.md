<h1 align="center">What is a Derivative?</h1>

A **derivative** represents the **slope** of a tangent line to a curve, or in other words, how fast something is changing at a particular point.

For example, if you're tracking the **position of a moving car**, the derivative of its position tells you the **velocity** ‚Äî how fast and in what direction it's moving.

### ‚úèÔ∏è Simple Power Rule Example

To keep things simple, let's say we‚Äôre asked to find the derivative of this polynomial:

$$
f(x) = 2x^7 + 8x^2 + 9x
$$

Our goal is to apply the **power rule** to each term:

> **Power Rule:**  
> If \( f(x) = ax^n \), then  
> \( f'(x) = a \cdot n \cdot x^{n-1} \)

So let's apply it term by term:

- \( 2x^7 \rightarrow 7 \cdot 2x^{6} = 14x^6 \)
- \( 8x^2 \rightarrow 2 \cdot 8x^{1} = 16x \)
- \( 9x \rightarrow 1 \cdot 9x^{0} = 9 \)

Therefore, the derivative is:

$$
f'(x) = 14x^6 + 16x + 9
$$

Feel free to try more examples or explore how this applies to real-world physics like motion, acceleration, or even optimization in economics!

Let me know if you‚Äôd like to do a deeper analysis of derivatives or related topics.
