<h1>What is a Derivative?</h1>

Derivative represents slopes of tangent lines and rates of change (such as velocity), in this case, the position of a car moves at different times. To put it simply, you're going to subtract the power of numbers and multiply them to the value i.e.

$$
2x^7 + 8x^2 + 9x
$$

Our goal is to derive the equation above to this:

$$
14x^6 + 16x + 9
$$

We can achieve this equation by subtracting $$2x^7$$ by 1 and then multiply it to 7 which is $$14x^6$$

or if you understand by writings then this is for you: ~~good luck reading my writings lol~~
