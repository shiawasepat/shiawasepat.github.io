## **When did it all started?**

It all started way back when me and my family was travelling Makassar (Let's say I was around 10 years old at that time), when we visited one of the malls that only had a maimai machine in town. I was curious since there wasn't a rhythm game that when I play, I wouldn't be exhausted.

This picture on the top is the one and only maimai cab that's (currently) available in Makassar, I came there after my Student Union interview to kill some time and also try it before I'm not able to go again because of another activity that was coming 2 days after.
