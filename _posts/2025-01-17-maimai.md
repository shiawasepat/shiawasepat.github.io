## **When did it all started?**

It all started way back when me and my family was travelling Makassar (Let's say I was around 10 years old at that time), when we visited one of the malls that only had a maimai machine in town. I was curious since there wasn't a rhythm game that when I play, I wouldn't be exhausted.

So then I discovered this interesting looking circular machine that has buttons around it, I don't exactly remember my first experience with it, but I remember fc'ing a Pokemon song

On the left, you can see the one and only **maimai cab currently available in Makassar**. I made my way there after my Student Union interview to kill some time and, more importantly, to try it out before another activity in my schedule took over just two days later.

Trying out this game was an unforgettable experience—it felt completely different from the original maimai machine! The buttons had a satisfying click, almost like using a mechanical keyboard. It was such a refreshing change, and I suspect this cab is either brand new or hasn’t been heavily used yet. The touchscreen was also incredibly smooth—gliding across it felt like butter.

It was a fleeting but meaningful moment to indulge in something so enjoyable amidst a busy schedule. It reminded me how even short, spontaneous breaks can create lasting memories.

The first song I picked was 踊 (Odo) by the incredible artist Ado. The song’s energy and vibe paired perfectly with the machine’s unique feel. This maimai cab was unlike anything I’d tried before. The buttons had a mechanical keyboard-like responsiveness, which was so satisfying to use. On top of that, the screen was amazingly smooth—my fingers glided across it effortlessly, as if it were coated in butter.

It’s clear the cab is either brand new or hasn’t seen much use yet because everything worked so seamlessly. The whole experience felt fresh and exciting, making it even more memorable. For me, it wasn’t just about playing a game; it was a moment of joy amidst a busy and eventful week.

## **The Grind**

The picture above is the only picture I had before I decided to play the game more seriously and all of that.
Ever since the game became available in the city, I’ve found myself diving deeper into it. It’s become more than just a passing activity—it’s now a hobby I genuinely enjoy and look forward to. Grinding through songs and improving my skills has turned into a fun and fulfilling way to unwind.

There’s something uniquely satisfying about setting small goals for myself, whether it’s perfecting a particularly tricky track or hitting a new high score. Each session feels like progress, no matter how small. I’ve started to appreciate not just the gameplay but also the artistry behind it—the vibrant visuals, the carefully curated songs, and the way it all comes together to create an immersive experience.

Playing has also introduced me to a new community of people who share the same passion. Whether it’s casual conversations about favorite tracks or friendly competition to see who can rack up the highest scores, it’s been a great way to connect with others. These shared moments add an extra layer of enjoyment to an already thrilling hobby.
