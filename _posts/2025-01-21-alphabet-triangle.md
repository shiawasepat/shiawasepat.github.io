I'm keeping this post as simple as it is because we've recently received this project as our assignment for one of our projects.

As we are closing this semester, we were assigned to design "something" out of this [8086 compiler](https://yjdoc2.github.io/8086-emulator-web/compile).

Each one of us are being told to draw a card out from our lecturer's based on our luck.
